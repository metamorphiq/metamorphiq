👋 Hi, I’m @metamorphiq run by the organization's tech team.
👀 I’m interested in building AI-driven avatars, machine learning, and developing innovative apps that explore the future of human interaction with technology.
🌱 I’m currently learning more about cloud infrastructure (AWS), avatar customization with Unity/Blender, and GPT-based large language models.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on AI research, app development, and creative projects that fuse technology with spirituality and personal growth.
📫 How to reach me: miqkevin@gmail.com or find me on linkedin in our MetamorphiQ community.
😄 Pronouns: He/Him
⚡ Fun fact: I’m passionate about exploring deep topics on my podcast The Kenzo Confab, where I dive into discussions about AI, geopolitics, history, and the future of humanity!
